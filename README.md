EC2 Bringup
===

EC2 bringup for autobootstrapping. Uses chef as the mechanism. Presumes, grotesquely, that all nodes are identical, 
and thus lays the ground for being a cluster Down The Mythical Road.

While the Chef code is grotesque, it is also brutalist, in the sense of architecture: everything's out there 
and dumb and simple and ugly.
